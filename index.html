       <p class="his"><font color="#000839"> I am studying <strong>Undergraduate</strong> in <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> at <strong>
        B.M.S. College Of Engineering</strong>. I am from Kalaburagi, Karnataka, India. I have being in the city
        for more a decade. Getting familiar with the city is a great experience. I live as a member of a traditional joint family.
        My family always helped me in each and every task I do and on my part I share every thing that I do, with my family.
        They are motivation for my journey into programming.</font>

     <img class="ass" src="images/target.png" alt="AI">
     <p class="aspi"><font color="#000839">Like everyone, I had many dreams too. First was to become a commercial pilot. But like most of them, had to drop the plan.
      Then after secondary education, for sometime I lived the dream of becoming a Doctor. Again like most of them,
      could not secure a seat in any college across the country. But then as everyone says,
      Fate decides everything. I started pursuing Mechanical Engineering at B.M.S. College Of Engineering.
      And now I aspire to become an <strong>Expert Web Developer</strong> and help the society in solving thier problems.
